First of all thanks to the people that participated in the pre alpha 2 week phase, we were able to locate a large amount of bugs and get some real testing finally done. Since the testing phase closed on Sunday 3rd, I was expecting to take quite a while to get things back online, I had a lot of infrastructure setting up to do and some final tweaks on my TODO list, but I've managed to plough through them and get the system back online. The new systems are hosted on the [Windows Azure](http://www.windowsazure.com) cloud service which allows me to have a little more control over whats going on than [nodejitsu](https://nodejitsu.com) did.

So, over the next couple of days I'll be reintroducing the pre alpha testers back online and I'll be conducting some more usage testing and hopefully getting any lingering fatal bugs out of the way. I'm then going to publically open the website for the first time, registrations will be controlled and users will be introduced in waves gradually scaling the service - I want to avoid giving everyone in the world an account then having the system fall to it's knees.

For the people that have been following the project closely, here is a changelog of whats been fixed since the pre alpha.
