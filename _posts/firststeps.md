It's been a while since anyone has seen any light on this project, and people have been occasionally getting in touch and asking me if it's still alive.  Well I'm pleased to say after about a month of cramming bug fixes and updates into it while trying to keep up with university, it's finally getting close to a stable version.

For those of you who don't know much about the project. It's a web client for IRC, but more specifically a web client which has a bouncer back end and keeps you connected all the time, and replays what you've missed while you've been gone.  IRC can be a hassle sometimes, especially if you want to keep connected all the time, you have to deal with finding a reliable host, paying money for a VPS if you don't have one because shell providers, well lets face it, they suck.  All that effort, and you still have to deal with things like making sure it's online all the time, adding multiple bnc's for different networks.  It's all hassle, this project aims to do all this for you, and wrap it up in a nice sleek modern web client, so IRC becomes as easy as just hitting a url.

Some of you may know it got released as an alpha test back in the summer, but just hadn't been tested enough and crumbled under the pressure.  Since I've started working on the project again I've taken the time to rewrite parts of the back end that were not scaling very well, the majority of it has been picked at and rewrote.  I'm fairly comfortable in saying that hopefully most of the crashes no longer exist and it should run nicely with no interruptions.

### So what happens now?

Well, just to be safe we don't have a repeat of last time I'm going to hand out a handful of accounts to people closely following the project and commence some internal testing, mainly for back end stability and critical bugs such as crashes and errors on the front end.  This internal testing phase is going to be running for around two week on the [nodejitsu](https://nodejitsu.com) platform (which is excellent may I add).

During the 2 week phase I'm going to collect a bunch of statistics on how well the system runs and other such nonsense that won't be of much use to anyone but me, hopefully pin point some critical bugs and fix them, and then compile a list of minors which can be fixed down the road.

The system will then be pulled offline for hopefully no longer than two week, where the main website will be open to the public, anyone will be able to sign up and have their email added to a list where you'll be notified when the project enters it's next phase (don't worry you'll only get **one** email, I promise).

During that two week phase I'll be working on mainly setting up the infrastructure to go live, as it's not going to be hosted on nodejitsu due to some other complications.  Once the system goes live it will enter the first official closed stage, I'll be handing out a limited number of accounts to people that wish to follow the project, registrations on the website will be closed.  If at this stage you wish to have an account then feel free to contact me any way you can.

### Until then..
